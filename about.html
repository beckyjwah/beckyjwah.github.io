        <h2>My Life</h2>
        <p>Ever since I was little, I drew a lot and did arts and crafts.  Starting in the fourth grade, art class became separate from homeroom classes. Art was the only way where I can relax and express how I feel.  I had learning difficulties when I was younger, but I felt like I have a connection with art.  I took art seriously.  I see what my teacher draws and I understand when my teacher teaches us his techniques. Not that I was not serious in my other classes, but it was hard in the other classes.  My mom quit her job to help me with my learning difficulties. I felt that I did not belong anywhere; I felt that I was really behind and was the always the last one.   I had no idea what my teacher would be talking about in class.  I felt like a cloud just drifting and no matter how much I tried to pay attention I could not seem to understand at all on what was going on, but what ever she wrote down on the board, I wrote down in my notebook, but art was different.  My mom always supported what I want to do. So, in the summer of 2015, I took two classes at SAIC.  In the morning I took figure drawing and in the afternoon, I took water base paints for two weeks.  It was a new experience and I got lots of critiques.  I find critiques very important because they make me think and improve my art.  In 2016, I took a class at SAIC and at Illinois Institute of Technology on architecture.  It was a totally different from drawing and painting.  Architecture is a completely new language in arts.   </p>
