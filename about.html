        <h1>My Life</h1>
          <div id="mylife">
          <h2>My Education</h2>
            <p> For high school I went to University of Chicago Laboratory Schools (2014-2017).  For art studio classes in high school (2016-2017), I have taken Advanced Drawing and Painting, Mixed Media, and Design Communication.  These classes have prepared me to make my studio art portfolio 
		and the Design Communication class has helped me to design my own website (still needs a lot of work and updates on more recent works).  So what you see on my website are art studio projects in my high school and high school summer works.  
		I took Figure Drawing and Water Based Paints (2015) and Intro to Architecture (2016) at SAIC, School of Art Institute of Chicago.  I also have taken an Intro to Architecture (2016) at IIT, Illinois Institute of Technology.  I then have discovered an affinity for Architecture.</p>
	    <p> I am currently at Mount Holyoke College and declared my major as Architectural Studies.  I have taken Being, Seeing, Making Art Studio (Fall 2018), Drawing 2 (Spring 2019), Intermediate Studio: Environmental Principles (Fall 2019) at Mount Holyoke College.  I took Intro to Architecture (Spring 2019) at Smith College.  
		Other classes that relate to my major are Calculus 1 (Fall 2017) and Calculus 2 (Fall 2018), Engineering (Spring 2019), Physics-100 and Physics-150 (Fall 2018- Spring 2019), Engineering-132 (Spring 2019), Built Environment (Spring 2018), Modern Architecture (Fall 2018), and Gothic Architecture (Fall 2019).</p>
	  <h2> Future Plans and Giving back to Society</h2>
	    <p> There is a very small population of females in Architecture considering it is a male dominated work field.  So seeing female architects and what they strive for inspire me to pursue in Architectural Studies.  I took a geography class, Citites in a Global Context, (Spring 2018) before taking any architecture studio classes and 
	        it has taught me glabal issues such as pollution, homelessness, income classes, and many more.  A more specific topic we breifly went over was the Panopticon, an institutional building and a system of control.
		For me, this was one of the early examples of how architecture affects the space and it amazed me how a simple idea and design could intimidate a person.  Designing buildings are not just designing the exteriors, but also everything else that comes with it; exteriors and all the way as small as product designs.  
	        Furthermore, it is important that we design a more sustainable future for ourselves.  </p>
